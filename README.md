# Airline Strategy Capstone Project

## Overview
This project explores the **factors determining the success and failure of the airline industry in India**.  
It combines literature review, text analytics, and extended business analytics (forecasting, KPIs, pricing, route optimization) to provide recommendations for upcoming airlines such as **Akasa** and **Air India**.

---

## Role & Context
- MBA Business Analytics Capstone Project  
- Conducted as part of Christ University program  
- Focused on applying **analytics** to evaluate sustainability in the Indian airline sector

---

## Approach
- **Domain Research**: Literature review on Indian aviation growth, taxation, infrastructure, and regulations  
- **Text Analytics**: Extracted insights from news articles, reports, and case studies  
- **Case Studies**: Failures (Jet Airways, Kingfisher) and successes (Indigo, Ryanair, Southwest)  
- **Extended Analytics**: Demand forecasting, KPI dashboards, pricing analysis, route optimization

## Extended Analysis

### 📊 Demand Forecasting
- Passenger traffic projected to reach **520M by 2037**  
- Techniques: ARIMA, Prophet, regression models  
- Baseline CAGR ~6–7%, optimistic ~8%  
- Impact: Guides fleet expansion and infrastructure planning

### 📊 KPI Dashboards
- KPIs: Load Factor, RASK, CASK, On‑Time Performance, Fuel Cost Ratio  
- Tools: Excel, Power BI, Tableau  
- Impact: Real‑time visibility into operational health, supports executive decisions

### 💰 Pricing Analysis
- India’s market is **highly price‑sensitive**  
- LCCs rely on razor‑thin margins + ancillary revenue  
- Full‑service carriers struggle to compete on fares alone  
- Impact: Helps avoid unsustainable fare wars, supports revenue management

### ✈️ Route Optimization
- Hub‑and‑Spoke vs Point‑to‑Point models  
- Metro hubs saturated → delays, fuel wastage  
- Tier‑2/3 cities show rising demand → profitable niche routes  
- Impact: Hybrid models balance efficiency and growth

---

## Key Findings
- High taxation and poor infrastructure drive costs  
- Leadership failures (Jet Airways) highlight governance risks  
- Currency depreciation and rigid regulations strain profitability  
- New entrants must balance **pricing, route strategy, and operational KPIs** to sustain growth

---

## Impact
- Provided actionable recommendations for upcoming airlines (Akasa, Air India)  
- Showcased holistic approach: literature + data + strategy
